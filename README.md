This program is designed to be a text based dnd version of MacBeth.

#REQUIREMENTS
-tkinter
-python

The user should expect to be able to create a dnd version of MacBeth of several different classes that are not from DND but are more
random. Each class has three weapon choices. There are no stats or stat modifiers. Each class should affect how the game is played and
progressed. Some classes will have advantages that others do not on different quests and challenges.

#HOW TO RUN
Have the MacBeth_runner.py file opened and run that file. This file is what runs the program.

#HOW TO TEST
This program has a text slower that is easy to change.
slow_printer = Slowprinter(delay=0.00) would make the text instant and allow the program to run at normal speed. This line of code is at
MacBeth_runner.py file at line 16.

#ATTEMPTED CHALLENGES FOR THE PROGRAM
1. set up a gui - check
2. set up the gui have a functioning selection and save ability - check
3. set up the gui to have a functional back button - 3 hours attempted to no success
4. use a stack somewhere, preferrable keeping track of coins or use to the back button to track questions.
5. implement hashing or an encryption and decryption algorithm.
